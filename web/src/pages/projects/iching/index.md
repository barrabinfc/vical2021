<div class="description">

Me and friends used to start the day by playing the IChing[^1]. It was fun and most of all, inspirative. The IChing[^1], also know as Book of changes is a ancient chinese Tao classic and full of meditative advice for **virtue**, **inner strength and integrity**. I'm not living with those friends anymore, but i miss those morning rituals.

So i've created my own mobile application
of the IChing[^1]. My goal in the project was to create a clean and lightweight application using only contemporary web technologies. I built it with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) for offline support and [material-ui](https://mui.com/) for the UX.

The app is almost indistinguible from a native application, with a score of **90/100** in lighthouse[^2] performance benchmarks. ðŸ‘Œ

### Lessons Learned

The most important one is the performance of client-side rendering. When i started, i thought that
rendering on the client device using react was fast enough, since it's a common practice of the tech scene, but it showed it's limitations. Huge bundle output, poor performance on old mobile phones and a effective wall on lighthouse performance metrics around 80/90%. A sizable effort was done to minimize bundle size, remove dependencies and improve FCP time.

I now take great care for dependencies and bundle output. I avoid client-side rendering when possible using **island architectures**[^5] with Progressive hydration to acchieve extremely fast websites experiences. I've also
ditched webpack and core-js compilation in favor of [native javascript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
