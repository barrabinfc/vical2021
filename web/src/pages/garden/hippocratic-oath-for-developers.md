Let's face it, today software trends are user hostile. Every website in 2021 is hugely bloated, wants to send you notifications,
knows your location, and lock user generated data to only registered/paying customers. The web was born as a open digital garden to everyone
and it became a shopping mall, full of deceit and dark design patterns.

We need a code of ethics for software projects, for everyone involved: project Managers, CTO, Designers and Developers
This is my hippocratic oath, inspired by [other developers](https://den.dev/blog/user-hostile-software/).

## Always start with customer needs.

Those are the foundation of any software product. That’s why you are building the thing.

## Don’t impose artificial limitations on the customer.

That is, don’t require an account to change the keyboard LED scheme.
We know it’s possible - Ducky keyboards, for example, can be entirely managed through the keyboard itself, without any software.

## Respect user choices and privacy.

If someone doesn’t want to send telemetry (or any data for that matter), give them the option to not do it.

## Think beyond the “right now”.

Will your customer still be able to fully use your software and hardware in two years, after you shut down your web services?

## Don't lock user data. They're not ours.

Don't silo the user data. Files exists since 1970 and they work great!
Allow your apps to export and import data natively.

## Sometimes, no custom user experience is the best experience.

Maybe all you needed was just a driver after all?

## Design with acessibility of people in mind.

Software should be acessible to most people on most devices.
Almost no one have sharp eyes, huge monitors and a quick internet.

## Follow standards.

Unless those standards have limitations that cannot be solved.
Then come up with a better standard, so that we can have a standard standard.
Or, you know, we could start with just using OpenRGB for light control for literally any LED that is attached to a computer.

## Follow the principle of least privilege.

Your app that changes fan speeds doesn’t need local network and location access, with the customer’s Tuesday breakfast menu inspection. It just needs to be able to talk to a USB device.

## Give the choice of one-time payment.

You don’t need to work for free. Just limit the user to no updates for your software (or limited number of updates). You’d be surprised for how many use cases that’s enough.

## Be ethical.

This is the most straightforward - just do what is right for the customer.
Don’t deceive, utilize dark patterns, or trick whoever is using your software.
Get the job done and get out of the way.
